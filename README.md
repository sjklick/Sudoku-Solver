Summary
-------

This is an implementation of a solver for the popular Soduku puzzle.
The application is written with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Program Explanation
-------------------

This solver uses a recursive algorithm to try possible options until a solution
is found. At each iteration and each square, it checks which numbers (1-9 inclusive)
are available for use based on the corresponding row, column, and 3x3 block, and
updates the possible options accordingly.
